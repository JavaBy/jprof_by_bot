= Pins

This feature allows user to temporary pin posts in the chat by replying with a `/pin` command to them.

Posts are pinned for 1 hour by default, but other durations could be provided, like `/pin 2 hours 30 minutes`.
Check out link:src/main/kotlin/by/jprof/telegram/bot/pins/utils/PinRequestFinder.kt[`PinRequestFinder`] for the full list of the supported temporal units.

Pinning is charged with a special in-chat link:../monies[currency], named "pins".
1 pin allows to pin a post for one hour.
Shorter durations are supported, but charged as a full hour.
Pins are charged upfront when pinning a post.

Pins are not returned when a post is preemptively unpinned by an admin.
